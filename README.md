# Most influential books for programmers

These are books considered most influential for programmers from this [StackOverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-read) in no particular order. 
Forked in December 2018. Adding more books from the rest of the StackOverflow thread and updating some of the links. Omitted some books for being too specific or too off-topic.

## Original thread

"What is the single most influential book every programmer should read?

If you could go back in time and tell yourself to read a specific book at the beginning of your career as a developer, which book would it be?

I expect this list to be varied and to cover a wide range of things."
