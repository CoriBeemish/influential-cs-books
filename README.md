# Most influential books for programmers

These are books considered most influential for programmers from this [StackOverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-read) in no particular order. Forked in December 2018. Adding more books from the rest of the StackOverflow thread and updating some of the links. 

## Original thread

What is the single most influential book every programmer should read?

If you could go back in time and tell yourself to read a specific book at the beginning of your career as a developer, which book would it be?

I expect this list to be varied and to cover a wide range of things.
